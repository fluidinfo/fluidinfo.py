This is a very thin wrapper on top of the FluidDB RESTful API. FluidDB is an
openly writable platform for the web of things. More information about FluidDB
can be found here:

http://fluidinfo.com/

The RESTful API is described here:

http://api.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/api/*/*/*

Originally based upon work by Seo Sanghyeon found here:

http://bitbucket.org/sanxiyn/fluidfs

This module has been extracted, extended and unit-tests were added by Nicholas
Tollervey (http://ntoll.org)

Feedback welcome!
